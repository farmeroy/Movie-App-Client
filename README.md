<h1>Movie App Client</h1>
This is the client side application for my 'Pre-code Flix' web app.
It integrates with the backend API to allow users to create a new account, browse through all their favorite 1920s/1930s movies, and curate their own collection.
It is built using React and bundled with Parcel.
