<h1>Movie App Client</h1>
This is the client side application for my 'Pre-code Flix' web app.

It integrates with the [backend API](https://github.com/farmeroy/Movie-API) to allow users to create a new account, browse through all their favorite 1920s/1930s movies, and curate their own collection.

It was built using 
- React 
- Redux 
- React-Bootstrap
- Parcel

You can see the site live here: https://pre-code-flix.netlify.app 

Create a user account with a fake email (email@email.com) and then sign in to check it out :)
